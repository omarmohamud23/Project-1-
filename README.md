# Project-1-


WHAT MY PROGRAM DOES? 

#First this dice game gives our user a chance to roll the dice once /chnace to roll it Twice/or exit the game at all 
#if the user doesnt pick between 3 options they gey hit with a error message saying "Invalid option or choice"
#When the app runs it will randomly pick a number between 1-6 (You can set the numbers to whatever)
#Secondly, it will print whatever number you picked then it will ask you if you want to roll again or roll multiple dice
# i set a loop and spilt it into 2 options and a error messsage if you picked a different invalid choice
